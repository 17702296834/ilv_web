The full import path of this module is ilv.file
Programs that import and use 'file' stand a better chance of bening
portable between different platforms. Of course,they must then only use
functions that are defined by all paltforms (e.g.,unlink and opendir),
and leave all path name manipulation to ilv.path(e.g.,split and join).
